# TGATE: Cross-Attention Makes Text-Conditional Diffusion Inference Cumbersome

## ü•≥ Quick Introduction

> We find that cross-attention outputs converge to a fixed point during the initial denoising steps. Consequently, the entire inference process can be divided into two stages: an initial semantics-planning phase, during which the model relies on text to plan visual semantics, and a subsequent fidelity-improving phase, during which the model tries to generate images from previously planned semantics. Surprisingly, ignoring text conditions in the fidelity-improving stage not only reduces computation complexity, but also slightly increases model performance. This yields a simple and training-free method called TGATE for efficient generation, which caches the cross-attention output once it converges and keeps it fixed during the remaining inference steps.

>  The images generated by the diffusion model with or without TGATE. Our method can accelerate the diffusion model without generation performance drops. It is training-free and can be widely complementary to the existing studies.

## üìñ Key Observation

![](./src/observation.png)

>  The images generated by the diffusion model at different denoising steps. The first row feeds the text embedding to the cross-attention modules for all steps. The second row only uses the text embedding from the first step to the 10th step, and the third row inputs the text embedding from the 11th to the 25th step.

We summarize our observations as follows:

* Cross-attention converges early during the inference process, which can be characterized by a semantics-planning and a fidelity-improving stages. The impact of cross-attention is not uniform in these two stages.

* The semantics-planning embeds text through cross-attention to obtain visual semantics.

* The fidelity-improving stage improves the generation quality without the requirement of cross-attention. In fact, a null text embedding in this stage can improve performance.

## üñäÔ∏è Method

* Step 1: TGATE caches the attention outcomes from the semantics-planning stage.
```
if gate_step == cur_step:
    hidden_uncond, hidden_pred_text = hidden_states.chunk(2)
    cache = (hidden_uncond + hidden_pred_text ) / 2
```

* Step 2: TGATE reuses them throughout the fidelity-improving stage.

```
if cross_attn and (gate_step<cur_step):
    hidden_states = cache
```

Compared with DeepCache: 
* TGATE can cache one time and re-use the cached feature until ending sampling. 
* TGATE is more friendly for Transformer-based Architecture and mobile devices since it drops the high-resolution cross-attention.
* TGATE is complementary to DeepCache. 

Compared with Adaptive Guidance: 
* TGATE can reduce the parameters in the second stage. 
* TGATE can further improve the inference efficiency.
* TGATE is complementary to non-cfg framework, e.g. latent consistency model. 
* TGATE is open source.
